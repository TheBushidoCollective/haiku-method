# Development Stage — Elaboration

## Criteria Guidance

Good criteria examples:
- "All API endpoints return correct status codes for success (200/201), validation errors (400), auth failures (401/403), and not-found (404)"
- "Test coverage is at least 80% for new code, with unit tests for business logic and integration tests for API boundaries"
- "No TypeScript `any` types in new code without a documented justification comment"

Bad criteria examples:
- "API works correctly"
- "Tests are written"
- "Types are correct"


## Quality Gate Format

Unit `quality_gates:` frontmatter MUST use executable gate objects, not prose strings. Each entry is `{ name, command, dir? }` — the FSM runs the command at advance_hat time; non-zero exit blocks the advance. Commands MUST scope to the full stage artifact directory (e.g. `stages/{stage}/artifacts/`), not only the unit's declared `inputs:` list — enforcement scope must match rule scope, or regressions creep back onto files no unit audited. Prose descriptions of intent belong in the unit body under `## Completion criteria`, not in the frontmatter. The universal gate guidance injected into every `elaborate` action's output carries the worked canonical example.
